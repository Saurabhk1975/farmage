      <p className='mt-4 text-brown'>
        Farmage is a Mumbai–based premium makhana brand directly connected with the
        farmers of Madhubani, Bihar — the birthplace of the world’s finest fox nuts.
        We manage our entire supply chain end-to-end: sourcing, hand-processing,
        cleaning, grading, roasting and flavouring, all at our own facility.

        <br /><br />
        We supply makhana across India and also cater to <strong>bulk orders,
        wholesale requirements, private labeling, international export shipments and
        custom flavour production.</strong> Our processing standards ensure consistent
        quality, proper moisture levels and export-grade packaging.

        <br /><br />
